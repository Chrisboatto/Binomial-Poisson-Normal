**Lab 9**

Lab 9 in the CIND 123 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach the convergence of us the convergence of Binomial, Poisson and Normal distributions. 

To find the definition of the tree aforementioned distributions you can look back at the README files from the **Lab 6** and **Lab 8** repositories

To begin I would recommend reading the PDF file that explains each question and why it is done.
